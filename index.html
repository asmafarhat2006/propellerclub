                Welcome to the Propeller Club of Birmingham
The Propeller Club of the United Kingdom is a grassroots, non-profit organization, dedicated to the enhancement and well-being of all interests of the maritime community on a national and international basis. Membership is organized into local clubs called "Ports." There are 52 port chapters in the United States, 33 Clubs overseas, 16 Student Port Clubs in the U.S., and 5 Student Ports overseas. The Propeller Club aggressively promotes the maritime industry through many of its programs and by partnering with other similar organizations. Our goal is to educate legislators and the public as to the importance and necessity of all waterborne commerce.

The Propeller Club Port of Birmingham has more than 300 members from all facets of the maritime transportation and logistics fields. The Club hosts a number of networking events throughout the year. Its primary fund raising events are the well known Propeller Club Oyster Roasts held in April and October, and south Hampton Road's National Maritime Day Celebration in May at the Norfolk waterfront.

The Port of Birmingham has several charitable missions. The most notable are two annually endowed $5000 Old Dominion University scholarships to be awarded to a member of the ODU Student Propeller Club and the child of a merchant mariner, an annual gift of $2500 awarded to the Seafarers Agencies of Hampton Roads, and financial support for the Sail Nauticus Academy for kids through the Propeller Club Norfolk Judy Barrett Fund.
